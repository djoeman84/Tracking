      <h1>A Brief Introduction to Web Tracking</h1>
      <div class="featurette">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Web Tracking</h2>
        <p class="lead"> Web tracking is a function that web services have increasingly begun to employ in the past decade. We define web tracking simply, as logging user data and information. This includes, but is not limited to, user profile information (like name, gender, age, location, etc.) and behavioral information (i.e. visited web pages, amount of time spent per webpage, links that referred the user to the website, and websites that the user visits afterward). 
        </p>
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">How do Web Services Web Track?</h2>
        <p class="lead"> The top tool for web tracking is the http cookie. A cookie is simply a small packet of data containing five to six values including the name of the cookie, the values associated with the cookie, path information, domain information, expiration data, security information (if using ssl encryption).
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> The tracking cookie is believed to be invented in 1994 by Netscape engineers Lou Montulli and John Giannandrea as a way to store user information during and after surfing sessions. As demonstrated in the figure below, a tracking cookie is passed back and forth between a web server and browser. You can read more information about tracking with cookies at <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cookie2.htm">How Stuff Works</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="http://images.flatworldknowledge.com/collins/collins-fig15_012.jpg">
        <p class="lead">Institutions commonly have three end goals for tracking: security, convenience, and advertisement.</p>
        <p class="lead">Authentication cookies are the major example in online security. An authentication cookie ensures a user’s private profile information is only accessible if the user has provided a correct user name and password. </p>
        <p class="lead">Convenience refers to the functionality of an online shopping cart, or a web page’s deferral to the user’s native language.</p>
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Advertising?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Advertising is an industry dedicated to informing and encouraging potential consumers to buy a company’s product or service. Advertising comes in many forms, typically over media platforms, such as in newspapers, or as television commercials. By utilizing advertising strategies, companies hope to capture more of the market share in their respective industries. It is rare that a product or service can “sell itself”, so companies must actively promote and market their good to the public. Successful advertising campaigns boost sales, market share, and overall brand awareness.</p>
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Brief History of Online Advertising</h2>
        <p class="lead">However, the advertising industry has significantly changed due to the advent of online web tracking systems. The first instance of online advertising occurred in 1994 when online magazine, HotWired, sold advertising space to AT&T. By 2009, online advertising accounted for 8.8 percent of all advertising in the United States. Because offline advertising, meaning TV, radio, print, billboard advertisements, are expensive, advertisers have gravitated more and more towards online advertising. In addition, the average consumer spends a significant amount of time using media and social media, such as FaceBook, games, and applications on their smartphones, and online streaming TV sites such as Hulu.</p>
        <p class="lead">Online advertising provides more efficient pairing of relevant ads with consumers. Increasingly, web tracking has enhanced online advertisers’ accuracy in targeting customers with ads tailored to their preferences. </p>
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Types of Online Advertising</h2>
        <ul style="text-align:left;">
          <li>Display advertising is similar to the example provided by HotWire online magazine and AT&T. Companies can buy ad space on other websites that link to their own website.</li>
          <li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is a strategy that companies use to ensure that their links show up at the top of a search engine result page, thereby driving more traffic to their website.  This is typically a paid exchange; for example, if Coca-Cola wanted their website to show up first for a search on Google for “soda”, they would pay Google a certain amount of money to be the top result.</li>
          <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is much like SEM, with the exception that it un-paid. For example, searching for “Macintosh Computers” on Google will display <a href="http://www.apple.com">www.apple.com</a> as the first result.  Since Apple is the manufacturer of Mac computers, they naturally showed up first in the results due to an algorithm.  Apple did not have to pay Google.</li>
          <li>Social Media Marketing is when a company, for example, creates a “page” on FaceBook to promote their business.</li>
          <li>Social Media Marketing is when a company, for example, creates a “page” on FaceBook to promote their business.</li>
          <li>E-Mail marketing is commonly employed by many companies, by sending periodic messages to users on their mailing lists.</li>
          <li>Referral marketing promotes a product or good by word-of-mouth.</li>
          <li>Affiliate Marketing occurs when one business “rewards affiliates for each visitor or customer brought about by the affiliate’s own marketing efforts.”</li>
          <li>Content marketing is a method in which infographics or online pamphlets are developed for customers to learn more about a product.</li>
          <li>Inbound marketing relies on informing the customer about the product, and about the product potentially is addressing, as well as competitive landscape of the industry, in an attempt to convert consumers into repeat buyers.</li>
          <li>Video marketing is typically more expensive, but another way that companies engage users using media, to illustrate the potential benefits of a product. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Ethical Implications</h2>
        <p class="lead">The ethics of online tracking is hotly debated. Information privacy and security is a topic becoming increasingly important to individual users, companies and institutions, and even the government in an attempt to ward off potential cyber-security attacks. Some users feel that their privacy is being violated from online web trackers, often because they don't know what information is being tracked, where the information goes, and what the information is being used for. </p>
        <p class="lead">As an analogy, it would potentially be seen as being unethical if each customer that entered a Costco was tracked for how long they spent in the store, everything they bought, method of payment, where they came from before they entered the store, and what they did afterwards. Yet, in an online marketplace like Amazon, all of these behaviors and actions are tracked, without any regulation or rules.</p>
