          <p class="lead">Next we consider the implications of internet tracking on the freeness of the web. To do this, however, we must define what a “free web” entails. We will interpret the idea of “free” here to mean an internet not under the control of any person or organization. It must also be “fair,” for both viewers and contributors. And lastly, its workings must be transparent.</p>
        </section>



        <!-- Control of the Internet
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="control">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>Free of Control</h1>
          </div>
		  <img src="http://www.experian.com/blogs/marketing-forward/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/facebook-battles-google-01.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;">
          <p class="lead">First – does web tracking place the internet under any entity’s control? In March 2010, Experian Hitwise, an organization that collects data directly from internet service providers, reported that google.com saw 7.07% of all internet traffic, while facebook.com saw 7.47%. These two sites alone experience almost 15% of all activity on the web.</p>
		  <p class="lead">It is no secret that Google and Facebook track their users’ activity online. Every time a link or advertisement is clicked from Facebook or Google’s page, that click is recorded. Facebook’s “Beacon” tool allows companies to broadcast that a user visited their site to all of that users’ friends. And of course both sites tailor custom advertisements to users based on their navigation history.</p>
		  <p class="lead">With such a large volume of internet traffic going to Facebook and Google, these corporations significantly influence the rest of all web traffic through the ads and links they display on their sites. It could be argued, then, that internet is at least partially under the control of these digital giants. 
		  <p class="lead">Consider Google specifically. Websites rely on search engines to make their site accessible to the public. Google Executive Santiago de la Mora said himself, “Search is critical. If you are not found, the rest cannot follow.” Being indexable by search engines is so important to sites that <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/12/information-about-buying-and-selling.html">Google has had an ongoing problem</a> with sites that rank high by PageRank, its search algorithm, selling links to less known sites to improve their PageRank score. In this way, Google passively controls who sinks and who swims in the internet realm. Again from a Google executive, “[Google] is the biggest kingmaker on this earth.” <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/022403.html">(source)</a></p></p>
         </section>



        <!-- Fairness
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="fairness">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>Fairness</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">Next we consider the implications when this control over web traffic ceases to be passive. Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page themselves <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">wrote in 1998</a> that they expected advertising funded search engines would be inherently biased towards the advertisers, and away from the needs of the customers. They wrote that it is difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, and thus this so called “search bias” could pass unnoticed while still having a significant effect on the market. These are chilling words coming from the founders of the world’s currently most popular search engine.</p>
		  <p class="lead">Many believe Google is guilty of this very same practice. While we cannot discern if the search engine discriminates against others sites, we do see Google engaging in some questionable practices. The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704058704576015630188568972.html">wrote a couple years back</a> that Google has been increasingly promoting its own content over that of rival websites when users perform a search. TripAdvisor.com announced that the traffic it receives from Google’s search engine dropped over 10% just after Google began prioritizing its own services in its search algorithm. Even worse, these special Google results are made larger than any other result in the user’s browser.</p>
		  <p class="lead">It is true that sites like Google and Facebook need web traffic as much as any other site to survive, and should be expected to do whatever they can to boost their usage. But regardless, these practices have led to an internet that is no longer fair to both viewers and contributors. The average user expects to decide for themselves where to navigate on the web, but with digital giants dictating what users see, this is moving away from the truth. And internet publishers expect their content to be as accessible as any other site to the general public, but when their means of being publicized is also their competitor, they cannot expect equal treatment. According to a policy report in 2012, 73 percent of Americans objected to the idea of search engines tracking their searches, while two-thirds felt that this tracking might “limit the information they see” in future searches.<a href="#cite1"><sup>1</sup></a> Without the digital playing field being fair for everyone, it cannot be said that the internet is free. </p>
        </section>



        <!-- Transparency
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="transparency">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>Transparency</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">The last requirement for a free internet is transparency. Users of the internet should be fully aware of how and when they are having their browsing tracked, as well as how to opt-out. According to the same 2012 report, only 38 percent of Americans said they were familiar with ways to limit the information collected about their activities, such as using website privacy settings.
		  <p class="lead">When Facebook’s “Beacon” was introduced in 2007, <a href="http://www.corporate-ethics.org/pdf/Facebook%20_A_business_ethics-case_bri-1006a.pdf">the opt-out notice appeared in a small window</a>, which disappeared without users taking any action. Without acting quickly, the user could easily miss it entirely.  Similarly, after Google consolidated all its privacy policies into one, it produced something that has still been <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57421406-93/google-drive-terms-of-service-a-toxic-brew/">criticized by CNet</a> as deliberately confusing and inaccessible to the average reader.</p>
        </section>



        <!-- Ethics
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="ethics">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>Ethics</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">Now we consider – is this unethical? A deontologist would argue that depends on the intentions of the companies performing the tracking. Google’s well-known motto is “don’t be evil.” Google CEO Eric Schmidt stated that Google’s goal is ultimately to have the strongest advertising network and all the world’s information <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/micro-markets/google-ceos-new-paradigm-cloud-computing-and-advertising-go-hand-in-hand/369" style="font-size:xx-small;">(source)</a>. Sites like Google and Facebook do not collect their data with insidious intent, and would even argue they provide a better user experience by customizing their content and only showing them ads that might interest them. Thus any side effects on internet freedom are forgivable, since these corporations ultimately seem to have good intentions. </p>
		  <p class="lead">The utilitarian, however would argue that the impact on internet freedom is paramount, and that internet tracking as it exists today has done more harm than good, and therefore the actions of these web-trackers are unethical.</p>
