          <img class="featurette-image pull-right" style="margin:0 0 20px 20px" src="http://www.pr-squared.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220px-Edward_Bernays.jpg">
          <p class="lead">In the most generous understandings of advertising, we can see that it has many merits. Among them there is the ability that advertising bring to connecting interested partners to trade. For example, if someone is hoping to fly internationally, but is concerned about the prices, seeing an advertisement for cheap flights through a given service would potentially allow for the interested party to connect with the business, which would result in a mutually beneficial interaction. Secondly, there is the notion of equality in the market. In the same scenario, advertising can act as a normalizing agent in the market. If the scenario were that the interested party was looking for flights, but only had looked at listings from major carriers, and a smaller carrier offered a lower price, it would be hard for the interested party to discover this without some method of advertising. In this sense many would consider advertising a force in leveling the playing field of the market.</p>
          <p class="lead">There is, of course an opposing view. Among the most famous people in the history of advertising is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/16/specials/bernays-obit.html">Edward Betnays</a> who, as is widely accepted, introduced much of what is considered modern advertising. Bernays was among the first to combine psychological theory with the business of advertising. Bernays would use ideas from psychology to gain influence over those whom he was targeting in his advertisements. His most famous example what is know as the <a href="http://www.culturewars.com/CultureWars/1999/torches.html">Torches of Freedom</a> campaign, this campaign used influential women to create the idea in US culture that cigarettes were a symbol of female independence intelligence.</p>
          <p class="lead">Advertising methods such as those used by Bernays, although commonplace in modern advertising, ethically questionable in their use of psychology to, as many would consider it, exploit the psyche of the people in order to gain profits for corporations. Many would argue that the fact that advertising is so successful is a cause for alarm. If advertising were not in some way influencing the minds of people to will them to purchase things they would not have otherwise.</p>

        <!-- Introcuction of the Web 
        introcuction-of
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="introcuction-of">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1> Introcuction of the Web</h1>
          </div>
            <p class="lead"> It is important to ground any discussion of the ethics of web-tracking and targeted advertising in a consideration of the ethical implications of non-internet based advertising. Although online advertising may seem to many as a new and unique entity, and a revolution in the context of advertising, advertisers have always been interested in the notion of targeted advertising, and many of the core issues and concepts which drove advertising before the internet are still very relevant in today's applications of advertising. Advertisers in the past would have to be more creative and resourceful to attain the target audience they wished to achieve. For example, a corporation hoping to market their product to young men may have sought to place video advertisements on TV channels with a young audience. They may have attempted to gain that same market by holding events at a university, or sponsoring celebrities and athletes. Although the desire to target advertising has been intact since before the beginning of the internet, the web allowed for two major changes in the targeted advertising process. Firstly, advertising employees tasked with finding target audiences and assessing how to find them in the real world were replaced by machine learning algorithms which optimize relationships between advertisers and their target audience. Furthermore, the creativity in terms of the effort and diversity of advertising styles required to reach specific demographics was replaced by the instantaneous and nearly free resource that is the internet. Thus, it became incredibly more reasonable to launch a targeted advertising campaign as the relative cost between targeted advertising and traditional advertising approached zero.</p>

        <!-- Ethical Contrast 
        ethics
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="ethics">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1> Ethical Contrast</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">With the tools gained by advertising in the growth of the internet, it is clear to see that advertisers' ability to successful target consumers has increased. It is estimated that targeted advertising is <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/pdfs/Beales_NAI_Study.pdf">2.7 times as profitable</a> for corporation than traditional advertising. In this sense advertisers have the ability to leverage a much greater amount of information to model their advertising scheme so as to maximally exploit psychological tendencies to maximize profits.</p>
          <p class="lead">Although these developments in technology may seem alarming, as the capacity of the advertiser has greatly expanded, the moral and ethical implications of advertising have remained much the same. Issues pertaining to the exploitation of psychological tendencies to coerce consumers into purchasing goods are in this case just as relevant as they were before.</p>
          <p class="lead">From a <span title="let's be honest, this whole deontology vs utilitarianism thing is pretty lame: the is no such thing as utilitarianism without a prior set of metrics and weights, and there is no way to decide based on those thoughts without some system of weighing. They are not to be contrasted as they are really two aspects of any moral system. There is no person who does not utilize utilitarianism and deontology. Ay yay yay... ok, I'll finish writing">deontological perspective</span>, the change represents little change, since no moral boundary was crossed which wasn't there before. However, a <span title="back for more?? clever you... ok, here's something... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">utilitarian</span> perspective may be more conflicted. On one hand, the increased capacity of the advertising firms enables a higher level of exploitation, whereas on the other hand, the higher level of customization allows for a greater chance that advertising will pursue the role of connecting people with products. Furthermore, internet based advertising paired with targeted and machine learning approaches enables small firms to spend less on advertising and increases their ability to connect with customers they may not have been able to reach before. For example, a magazine for Arabic speaking gardening enthusiasts may have had an extremely difficult time reaching a large number of interested consumers, especially overseas, but with targeted advertising, internet tracking would allow advertising firms to connect those interested in these topics with this magazine, thus connecting interested parties as well as leveling the playing field.</p>
