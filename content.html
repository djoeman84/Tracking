          <div class="page-header">
            <h1> How is Content Customized</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">As stated above, content is customized employing user data. Though it is easy to immediately site web services like Google and Facebook as content customizers, the technique is hardly a high tech innovation.
          </p>
          <img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/709/249/320/cc-050728GroceryCereal.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;">
          <p class="lead"> Take into consideration a trip to the grocery store. The grocery only needs a few pieces of broad data to customize their layouts and content effectively. For example, depending on the time of the year, you might expect the front of the store to be loaded with seasonal products. The use of data is more striking in the cereal aisle. As noted by <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/more-shopping-storing/grocery-store-layout-00100000082999/page15.html">RealSimple</a>, groceries use different shelves to move product to different consumers. The top shelves contain healthy products, and those products that might catch the eye of the average adult. On the other hand, the middle shelves hold all of the sugary, cartoon-covered boxes attractive to kids. Since this discussion is grounded in an ethical framework, this example is used to reveal the ubiquity of content customization in our everyday lives.
          </p>
          <p class="lead"> Though the ethics of marketing to kids is of major debate, the above example helps create a distinction between the different components of content customization and how ethical frameworks can be applied to those components individually. Thus, content customization can be divided into two categories: acknowledged and unacknowledged. 
          </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Acknowledged Content Customization
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="acknowledged-content-customization">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1> Acknowledged Content Customization</h1>
          </div>
          <pc class="lead"> Acknowledged content customization is defined in this discussion as any filtering of content using data actively provided by the user. Examples for acknowledged are the user provided “preferred language” on some sites, or user profile features like the “wishlist.” Acknowledged content customization is distinguished by what an individual user might reasonably expect a web service to filter.
          </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Unacknowledged Content Customization
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="unacknowledged-content-customization">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1> Unacknowledged Content Customization</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead"> Unacknowledged content customization is the dual to acknowledged customization, defined in this discussion as the filtering of information and content using user data provided without that user’s active participation. Note that unacknowledged content customization can encompass information gathered from a user without his/her consent, but does not explicitly narrow the definition so. Unacknowledged content customization is best illustrated by the cookies discussed earlier, though the user can and often knows they are there, the nuanced role these tools play tends to hide them from a user’s active consideration. In other words, though a user might expect their session’s shopping cart to save their items, the user might not expect those items to be added to a database used for advertising purposes in the future. 
          </p>
        </section>


        <!-- What Kind of Content is Customized?
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="what-kind">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1> What Kind of Content is Customized?</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead"> On the web, content customization is ubiquitous. For the purpose of this ethical discussion, content customization will deal mostly with the customization of the media the average user faces. Media is important because it provides the user with the information needed for participation as a citizen of the world.
          </p>
          <img src="http://chris-green.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/The-Filter-Bubble.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;">
          <p class="lead"> Eli Pariser describes the customization of our content in his book The Filter Bubble as “a return to a Ptolemaic universe in which the sun and everything else revolves around us. But it comes at a cost: Making everything more personal, we may lose some of the traits that made the Internet so appealing to being with” (Pariser, pg. 12). Pariser expands on the ways content customization develops a filter bubble around individual users in his TED talk, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html">"Beware of online 'Filter Bubbles'"</a>. These include the differing search results driven by Google, the nature of the Netflix queue, the social side of news platforms like the New York Times, and <a href="http://dontbubble.us/">more</a>.
          </p>
        </section>


        <!-- Is it Ethical?
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="is-it-ethical">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1> Is it Ethical?</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead"> According to the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>, deontology “falls within the domain of moral theories that guide and assess our choices of what we ought to do (deontic theories), in contrast to (aretaic [virtue] theories) that—fundamentally, at least—guide and assess what kind of person (in terms of character traits) we are and should be”. This infers a morally right and wrong choice with regards to online tracking, specifically content customization. If we subscribe to the premise that democracy is good for society and the individual, then content customization—both acknowledged and unacknowledged—can be framed as morally wrong. The effect of the “filter bubble” is the segmentation of users into spheres of similar interest. This means that interactions with dissimilar opinions are becoming increasingly rare. Some historians of science cite the cultural focus on debate in Ancient Greece as the foundation of Western Science. Without debate, the same ideas are recycled and rehashed, and new ones are never allowed to grow.
          </p>
          <p class="lead"> The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/">utilitarian framework</a> provides a more complex debate regarding the ethics of content customization. On one hand, content customization is literally utilitarianism in an optimal form (i.e. maximizing a web experience for each individual user). Since utilitarianism is often measured in terms of happiness, content customization can be seen as the filtration of user data to maximize a user’s happiness and avoidance of content that does the opposite. However, some might argue that since utilitarianism takes into account aggregate societal happiness, that the negative social effects manifested in the “filter bubble” mentioned above might serve as a disutility.
          </p>
          <p class="lead"> This is where the different components of content customization help make ethical sense of a complex issue. That is to say, most forms of acknowledged customization are morally good from a deontological and utilitarian perspective. Deontologically filtering is good because it asks the user for permission, often freeing the user from any harm. However, unacknowledged content customization is morally wrong because it hides the moving pieces from the user. Though democracy does invoke a certain degree of civic duty onto it’s participants, users in modern day society are presented with so much media that the decision to “opt out” of certain discussions is necessary. However, in order for the filtering to be considered morally passible, only the user should have that ability to opt out. In other words, the “filter bubble” effect is a violation of the user’s right to engage in society as he or she sees fit.
